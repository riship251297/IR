Objective:
The query should retrieve customer identifiers from the database for reporting or analysis purposes.

Requirements:

The query must return only the customer_id column from the relevant table.

No additional columns or data should be included in the output.

The query should ensure uniqueness of customer_id values, i.e., no duplicates in the results.

The query must be efficient and optimized, avoiding unnecessary joins, calculations, or filtering unless explicitly required.

The output should be suitable for further processing, reporting, or insertion into other tables if needed.
